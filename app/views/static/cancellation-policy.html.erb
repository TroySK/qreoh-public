  <h1 class="text-lg">Cancellation &amp; Returns Policy</h1>
  <p>QREOH believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 72 hours of placing a order. However, the cancellation request will not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.</li>
    <li>In case of receipt of damaged or defective product, please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once the Designer has checked and determined the same at their own end. This should be reported within 10 days of receipt of the products.</li>
    <li>In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service within 48 hours of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will process and refund or replacement for the item received.</li>
  </ul>
